If I told the moon what you did,

Would you walk under a dark sky?

Echoes of our last words are fading from my memory

Warmth from the last kiss, cold on a sunny day

How can you be okay?

How could you never reach out?

Why couldn’t you just try while I was there in your arms

I can’t help but think there was never a true chance for us

Not because we didn’t connect but because you didn’t see me that way

I still try to prove myself to your standards

Because I hope that when you look at me you cannot deny my existence

But you act as though you don’t know me

If someone were to ask you if you knew me

What would you say my love?

Will your hatred of me bleed through

Or have you cut me out completely

In a terrible way I hope you never reach comfort seeing me around

That your eyes still dart away when we cross paths

That if I were to speak to you there would be a sadness I can feel in my own chest

That talking about me still hurts you

But the day you relax I feel my heart will shatter again

For I am still sitting here with my hands stretched out

My eyes closed

Hoping you will take me upon you

Is she what you truly wanted?

Like a funhouse mirror you stole my reflection

And gave her love that was not made for her

For that love was made from tears

Not hers, not yours,

But tears that can now only watch that love from the distance

My love did you ever truly consider me?

Was I more than just a temporary game?

I should wish for your happiness

Your growth, and for you to be in love

There will be no one that loves you the way I do

For even now when you give me nothing 

I still wonder If I told stars

Would they hope for us as well.
