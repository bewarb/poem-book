Hauntingly, the melody of your actions

I search for with my ears, 

Beg with my eyes,

Unravel the stillness of my soul.

My muse,

A terrible concoction,

A Frankenstein of memories and thoughts

That only I contain.

Tapping away, trying to reach you

My intensity can’t be mapped to words

I can only hope that someone feels the

Twistedness of my yearning.

Morbid hums, have evaded for some time,

But always sitting at the ledge

And I always inching forward

For death who died many months ago,

Persons that cannot be brought back around

My muse, you made me believe in the future

What is this betrayal? You can tell everyone you

Don’t hate me

But my love, I know you better than anyone.
