I am the kingmaker,

If I choose you, you will live the life fitting a real king,

Miracle after miracle,

Like a sickly sweet dream

I will look like an innocent red flower

For if I bless you with my soul,

You will crave me wherever you go,

You can try to find me in roses or hibiscus

But you will think you need me 

More than you need air

But what happens to those who cross the maker?

They all think that I will always be there

That I will give and keep giving like a saint

The greatest punishment I could give,

Is to make you normal.

For it was my presence that made you king,

And it was your luck that I saw something in you.

I am growing tired as the kingmaker,

There are few worthy, and a jester always appearing

I think my final and most fruitful attempt,

I will become king.

Those who thought my blessings were only natural,

Live in fear for what happens,

When the kingmaker becomes King.
