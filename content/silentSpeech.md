How is it?

Like an impossible magnet 

Whenever we are in range of each other

We know where the other end is

I have yet to enter a space that you are in

And not feel the end of the red string that was

Once stronger than steel

I know you feel it too

Sometimes you feel it before I do

I do not know your mind now

I will never forget your soul 

But why do you bare your thoughts at me

But keep your tongue

Good.

Don’t be comfortable with my presence

Not with my absence

So please do not glance at me

Not while you show others a smile 

I won’t get to experience again

I am still sitting

Trying to mend the cut

But a seamstress with no hands

Cannot do much

Give them to me

Come share the words you are so afraid of

Let us swim in the pain

Open old wounds

Make me real again

More than a ghost that haunts your gaze

Tell me one last time that you love me

So, no matter who you decide to give my place to

I will know

And they will feel deep down

That with time

Our string will make diamonds cower

You know this as well as I do

It is your fear of speaking to me

Maybe it is hatred

But let me never leave your mind

And stain your heart.
