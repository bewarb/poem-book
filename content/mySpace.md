If you just need someone to be in your life

Just not to leave you empty

Someone to confide in

Someone to trust

If you just need someone

Let it be me. 

Don’t let me go

Don’t forget me

If it means just filling a space,

Let me fill it

Not that I don’t respect myself

But I know your heart

The things I would tell you

Even the things I was too afraid to admit aloud

Let me use you for structure

Let me build my confidence with your presence

Let me burrow so deep in your mind and heart

That you can never think someone else can fill that space.

For anyone else will never truly know the kaleidoscope of your soul

I will guard your thousand faces, at no cost.
