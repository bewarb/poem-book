It feels as through time keeps moving for everyone, but I am

Still stuck in place, with feelings that I canâ€™t explain why still linger

Truthfully, have I really tried to let them go?

I am afraid that if I stop trying, I will never receive my wish

Losing a battle that only I seem to be fighting

Lowering myself, shame can only create regret

Let us break free, what traps our hearts what leaves them in pain

Over the past, is it possible to start anew?

Varying dreams, seeing events that will never happen

Even when awake

Yet I still hope that somehow, there will be a song of our truths

Overly loud, chaotic but harmonious melody

Until then, I will wait for you with my instruments.
