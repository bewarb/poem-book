I realized today there is something wrong with the way I think

My roommate explained how

She understood she didn’t like someone because she wouldn’t

Want to switch places with them.

How odd? Is this normal?

I would never want to switch places with anyone,

Not even my worse enemy, 

For what crime did they commit to have to live in my place.

Maybe I have tainted the view of my existence,

But I cannot imagine a more terrible fate than to have to switch places with me

,even for a moment.
