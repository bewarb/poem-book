I CANT FUCKING DO THIS ANYMORE IM DONE I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE EVERYTHING ALL I WANTED WAS TO ENJOY LIFE AND BE HAPPY I CANT BREATHE I ACTUALLY CANT BREATHE EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE A CONSTANT PANIC ATTACK MAYBE I NEED THERAPY ITS TOO LATE I WANT TO SCREAM SO BAD I FEEL LIKE I AM BEING TRAMPLED

I donâ€™t think I can. Forgive him this time

My heart is too thin

This is what you call selfish depression

For I no longer care how this will impact him

He will see how ugly I am

I will make sure

And this ugliness will stain forever

All this love I hold on to will dissipate on his side

For if he tried to hold on like I do

He too would dissipate.
