It is such a simple truth

But I acted as though it would never be possible

So plain, its elegance almost evil

Our silence would live forever

If I were to let go as you have

As my sound

And my image

My touch

Fade from you mind

Do you mourn my soul?

Or just regret that I exist with the perception of your actions

Your false words

False hopes

I still am here believing that you would never be okay with

Never hearing my voice again

Seeing my smile

The simple truth

Is that you have always been okay with that

And will be okay with that

A comfort I am not sure I am capable of
