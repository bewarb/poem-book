As I build you a soft grave

Cushions of flowers

Long dead and freshly wilted

I lay down to face the stars

With one big breath

I rise

To warmth

I see the shadow of my heart

Remains

When I look to my stone

For the reason

I see our names 

Permanently engraved.

But I remember this tomb

Was made for only one.
