I wonder if you will ever know how my spirit protected you

That at night and day how I prayed for your happiness and never mine

That even in my most hopeless hour

I didn’t give up because I didn’t want to leave you alone

“I will be good just take away his pain”

All you did was hurt your ankle

I didn’t even remember I hadn’t eaten in two days

Even in absence of care I still wished

“Let him heal quickly”

When it didn’t work i couldn’t help 

But wonder had my price gone down.

I thought I gave you my heart

I gave you all of it with no regret

But only now I admit I gave my mind and spirit

You didn’t earn it but you had my soul

You knew this as well as I did

So you treated it as the dirt cheap bargain it was

Just don’t leave me alone

I don’t want to be alone 

I’m tired of hearing my own echoes

The Devil, these are dangerous words

Ideas that have no plans of the future

My poor spirit, how I’ve mistreated you

My mind in tatters, the song it used to play now an unrecognizable tune.

You came to me when I didn’t search for you

When I didn’t need you

And by mistake, I hanged my soul

My body now sits at a crossroads it does not belong

With each step I don’t take forward

I believe I’m sinkin’ down

My Devil, even if you told me what you were,

I think I would’ve sold you all I am at no cost.

No matter how many choirs tried to lead me down the glittering road

I dance for you at the crossroads,

Not to bargain because I have nothing left

But in hopes you are entertained to stay

For all it is worth, I think you knew what I sold you from the start.

But I am still figuring how to steal it all back from you.
