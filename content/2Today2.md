2Like a clock 

I can’t believe you were the first thing I thought of,

The first person, the first hope, my desire

greed bewilders

but how when on this day, I didn’t think of the warmth that has surrounded me

since before your appearance, and that will long after your absence,

your existence? Is it your disappearance that has plagued me with illness?

Or is it that you give your illness to someone else.

It steals my eyes, and melts my mind, makes me want to forget who I’ve become

Today is the first Today since you have been gone.

I guess like the many days before it, but this day has nothing to do with you

But is all about you

For me

I cry at the disappointment I am, 

For not understanding the comfort and beauty of those near

You’ve been a false sun in my sky for too long.

Ah. Is this moving on?

I guess it is gift in itself,

I still hope that your soul and heart find its way back to me,

Truth leaves my lips now when I say, but I won’t wait for you.

I guess this wisdom or hardening of age2.
