I feel as though you have stolen my mind

And the cries of my heart

Like some inquisitor

Your performance to hide

From the claims of my pain.

The strength of your hatred must

Come from some past life

For I must have wronged you then

To destroy my heart like this now.

I could not now wish my pain on

My worst enemy, only if you

Swore to understand.

You might make her think,

You might make everyone think,

But I know, I know that each loving move you make

Has my signature all over it.

You can try and craft her into my image,

But you will never be God.

What is the reward to show the unlovable

Love? To see all the sacrifice pawned off?

Thrown away like a broken glass, carefully 

Removing every shard to protect yourself?

I don’t care if she is the one

I don’t care if she is not

I will keep you in my heart forever now,

My Devil, I promise deep in my bones.

A sickly fusion of hate, disgust,

And for my weakness,

Love.
