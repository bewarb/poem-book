I think I finally found the courage

Maybe its despair

Desperation

I want to die

Again?

No.

It was on break and now its back

I want to make it worse

I want the attention I crave

But ive learned 

It will never come

Even these words as I write

As I pretend to ignore the secret hope someone will read these

Maybe if I orchestrate the 

“accidental” finding

Maybe it is not death

No

I don’t crave that

It is pain

I. want enough to

Never question my feelings

To fuel my anger

I know these words will get me in trouble one day

But so be it.
