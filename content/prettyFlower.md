Normally I would never think to compare myself to a flower

Not of any type, or color, wilted or just blooming

It would be like comparing heaven and hell.

I could never be as beautiful as a flower,

I am not allowed to resonate with them.

That is, until I realized,

That although my looks won’t place me in a bed of roses

It is the very nature of them serve as my reflection.

I’d let you pluck my petals until I am bare,

Just if it were for your entertainment.

You can take my pollen,

If it means it would serve others.

Use my leaves to cure your illness.

Give me away to show love to others.

You see, a flower left completely alone 

Is to be unknown, selfish really.

A flower uses its beauty to pull in others,

But the true being of flowers is to be ripped apart.

Let me give pieces of myself, until it is everything,

 And then let me give some more,

So all that remains is the memory of my beauty.
