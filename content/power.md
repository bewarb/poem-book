It is a cruel and unusual power humans have,
To forget someone’s existence,
A species that fought through time the chance to live,
Every struggle, victory to be forgotten.

Not to the world but to the individual,
We don’t all share the same characters.
Parallel and co-existing but never truly equal.

An oddity that our perspectives
That shape our world, and our cast, 
Give us a forbidden taste of being God.

Yet, although all humans possess this ability innately
The desire to scrape the edge of the heavens burns deeper in some,
It not the unwriting someone’s existence, 
It is the destruction of identity from false puppeteers,
In constant defiance of God.

And what of you? Yes you, I see you, I see your thoughts
Which character do you play in this game?

You see, as you read this you are in my game
And with every other word that makes a thought in your head,
I pull your string ever so gently.

I must, how else could I get you to feel my words, my ache,
When you could never fulfill my shoes.

Every temple needs worshippers,
A deity, its temple,
That’s why I hold to your strings as you read my words,
Tenderly, for I may be false, but I hope to spare you
From the loneliness of the “top”
