Pink roses

Nice and tall

Standing proud

But not even they compare

Not to the grand

Center piece

“My Valentine”

I did not know you

Even knew how to spell the word

Did not think you knew the shape

Of pink roses and baby’s breath

I did not think you knew

How to display your affection

To the world with pride in your heart,

Did I even know you?

I have never been a stranger to being alone on

This day, a fire now burns in my chest

Fueled by hot streams from above

My confusion of love and hatred,

I wish you could feel my burn,

May my tears destroy your foundation

And let me have a front row seat.
