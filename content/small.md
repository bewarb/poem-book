Even laying skin to skin

You never noticed how small I made myself

A diluted version of the person you fell for

Did you like me better small?

Always afraid of being let go

I shrunk myself even more

Until I couldn’t recognize myself

Surely I couldn’t get any smaller

So I asked you to let me grow

But you told me to shrink even more.

Would I have ever been the right size if I stayed?

I knew I could never be who you wanted

That all my changes could never be natural

But why use me? 

Did my smallness and love for you

Justify breaking me down until I didn’t know who I was

Even now I hope to see you again

To see if I have gained your respect

For you to see me

Sadly, my love would be all yours again 

If my existence could be enough for you
